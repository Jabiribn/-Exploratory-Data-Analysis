# ### How to choose the right visualization method?

# 
# When visualizing individual variables, it is important to first understand what type of variable you are dealing with. This will help us find the right visualization method for that variable.

# In[3]:


# list the data types for each column
print(df.dtypes)


# Question #1:
# What is the data type of the column "peak-rpm"?

# In[4]:


df["peak-rpm"].dtypes


# Question #2: 
# Find the correlation between the following columns: bore, stroke, compression-ratio, and horsepower.

# In[5]:


df[['bore', 'stroke', 'compression-ratio', 'horsepower']].corr()


# In[6]:


# Positive Linear Relationship 
# Engine size as potential predictor variable of price
sns.regplot(x="engine-size", y="price", data=df)
plt.ylim(0,)


# As the engine-size goes up, the price goes up: this indicates a positive direct correlation between these two variables. Engine size seems like a pretty good predictor of price since the regression line is almost a perfect diagonal line.

# In[7]:


df[["engine-size", "price"]].corr()


# We examine the correlation between 'engine-size' and 'price' and see that it's approximately 0.87.

# Highway mpg is a potential predictor variable of price. Let's find the scatterplot of "highway-mpg" and "price".

# In[8]:


sns.regplot(x='highway-mpg', y='price',data=df)


# As highway-mpg goes up, the price goes down: this indicates an inverse/negative relationship between these two variables. Highway mpg could potentially be a predictor of price.

# We can examine the correlation between 'highway-mpg' and 'price' and see it's approximately -0.704.

# In[9]:


df[['highway-mpg','price']].corr()


# Let's see if "peak-rpm" is a predictor variable of "price".

# In[10]:


sns.regplot(x='peak-rpm', y='price', data=df)


# Peak rpm does not seem like a good predictor of the price at all since the regression line is close to horizontal. Also, the data points are very scattered and far from the fitted line, showing lots of variability. Therefore, it's not a reliable variable.

# We can examine the correlation between 'peak-rpm' and 'price' and see it's approximately -0.101616. q

# In[12]:


df[['peak-rpm','price']].corr()


# Question 3 a): 
# Find the correlation between x="stroke" and y="price".
# 
# Hint: if you would like to select those columns, use the following syntax: df[["stroke","price"]].

# In[13]:


##The correlation is 0.0823, the non-diagonal elements of the table.

df[['stroke','price']].corr()


# Question 3 b):
# Given the correlation results between "price" and "stroke", do you expect a linear relationship?
# 
# Verify your results using the function "regplot()".

# In[14]:


sns.regplot(x='stroke', y='price', data=df)

"""There is a weak correlation between the variable 'stroke' and 'price.' as such regression will not work well.
We can see this using "regplot" to demonstrate this."""


# ### Categorical Variables

# These are variables that describe a 'characteristic' of a data unit, and are selected from a small group of categories. The categorical variables can have the type "object" or "int64". A good way to visualize categorical variables is by using boxplots.

# In[15]:


#Let's look at the relationship between "body-style" and "price".
sns.boxplot(x="body-style",y="price",data=df)


# We see that the distributions of price between the different body-style categories have a significant overlap, so body-style would not be a good predictor of price. Let's examine engine "engine-location" and "price":

# In[17]:


sns.boxplot(x="engine-location",y="price",data=df)


# Here we see that the distribution of price between these two engine-location categories, front and rear, are distinct enough to take engine-location as a potential good predictor of price.

# In[18]:


#Let's examine "drive-wheels" and "price".
sns.boxplot(x="drive-wheels",y="price",data=df)


# Here we see that the distribution of price between the different drive-wheels categories differs. As such, drive-wheels could potentially be a predictor of price.

# ### Descriptive Statistical Analysis

# The describe function automatically computes basic statistics for all continuous variables. Any NaN values are automatically skipped in these statistics.
# 
# This will show:
# 
# 1. the count of that variable
# 2. the mean
# 3. the standard deviation (std)
# 4. the minimum value
# 5. the IQR (Interquartile Range: 25%, 50% and 75%)
# 6. the maximum value

# In[19]:


df.describe()


# In[20]:


df.describe(include=['object'])


# Value Counts

# Value counts is a good way of understanding how many units of each characteristic/variable we have. We can apply the "value_counts" method on the column "drive-wheels". Donâ€™t forget the method "value_counts" only works on pandas series, not pandas dataframes. As a result, we only include one bracket df['drive-wheels'], not two brackets df[['drive-wheels']].
# 
# 

# In[21]:


df['drive-wheels'].value_counts()


# We can convert the series to a dataframe as follows:

# In[22]:


df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()


# Let's repeat the above steps but save the results to the dataframe "drive_wheels_counts" and rename the column 'drive-wheels' to 'value_counts'.

# In[27]:


drive_wheels_counts = df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()
drive_wheels_counts.rename(columns={'drive-wheels': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
drive_wheels_counts
#Now let's rename the index to 'drive-wheels':
drive_wheels_counts.index.name = 'drive-wheels'
drive_wheels_counts


# In[26]:


# engine-location as variable
engine_loc_counts = df['engine-location'].value_counts().to_frame()
engine_loc_counts.rename(columns={'engine-location': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
engine_loc_counts.index.name = 'engine-location'
engine_loc_counts.head(10)


# After examining the value counts of the engine location, we see that engine location would not be a good predictor variable for the price. This is because we only have three cars with a rear engine and 198 with an engine in the front, so this result is skewed. Thus, we are not able to draw any conclusions about the engine location.

# ### Basics of Grouping

# The "groupby" method groups data by different categories. The data is grouped based on one or several variables, and analysis is performed on the individual groups.
# 
# For example, let's group by the variable "drive-wheels". We see that there are 3 different categories of drive wheels.

# In[32]:


df['drive-wheels'].unique()


# If we want to know, on average, which type of drive wheel is most valuable, we can group "drive-wheels" and then average them.
# 
# We can select the columns 'drive-wheels', 'body-style' and 'price', then assign it to the variable "df_group_one".

# In[33]:


df_group_one = df[['drive-wheels','body-style','price']]
#We can then calculate the average price for each of the different categories of data.



# In[36]:


# grouping results
df_gptest = df[['drive-wheels','body-style','price']]
grouped_test1 = df_gptest.groupby(['drive-wheels','body-style'],as_index=False).mean()
grouped_test1


# In[37]:


grouped_pivot = grouped_test1.pivot(index='drive-wheels',columns='body-style')
grouped_pivot


# In[38]:


grouped_pivot = grouped_pivot.fillna(0) #fill missing values with 0
grouped_pivot


# Question 4:
# Use the "groupby" function to find the average "price" of each car based on "body-style".

# In[39]:


# grouping results
df_gptest2 = df[['body-style','price']]
grouped_test_bodystyle = df_gptest2.groupby(['body-style'],as_index= False).mean()
grouped_test_bodystyle


# Let's use a heat map to visualize the relationship between Body Style vs Price.

# In[40]:


#use the grouped results
plt.pcolor(grouped_pivot, cmap='RdBu')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()


# The heatmap plots the target variable (price) proportional to colour with respect to the variables 'drive-wheel' and 'body-style' on the vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. This allows us to visualize how the price is related to 'drive-wheel' and 'body-style'.
# 
# The default labels convey no useful information to us. Let's change that:

# In[41]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = ax.pcolor(grouped_pivot, cmap='RdBu')

#label names
row_labels = grouped_pivot.columns.levels[1]
col_labels = grouped_pivot.index

#move ticks and labels to the center
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(grouped_pivot.shape[1]) + 0.5, minor=False)
ax.set_yticks(np.arange(grouped_pivot.shape[0]) + 0.5, minor=False)

#insert labels
ax.set_xticklabels(row_labels, minor=False)
ax.set_yticklabels(col_labels, minor=False)

#rotate label if too long
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

fig.colorbar(im)
plt.show()


# ## Correlation and Causation

# Correlation: a measure of the extent of interdependence between variables.
# 
# Causation: the relationship between cause and effect between two variables.
# 
# It is important to know the difference between these two. Correlation does not imply causation. Determining correlation is much simpler the determining causation as causation may require independent experimentation.

# Pearson Correlation
# 
# The Pearson Correlation measures the linear dependence between two variables X and Y.
# 
# The resulting coefficient is a value between -1 and 1 inclusive, where:
# 
# 1: Perfect positive linear correlation.
# 0: No linear correlation, the two variables most likely do not affect each other.
# -1: Perfect negative linear correlation.
# 
# {{ df.corr() }}

# P-value
# 
# What is this P-value? The P-value is the probability value that the correlation between these two variables is statistically significant. Normally, we choose a significance level of 0.05, which means that we are 95% confident that the correlation between the variables is significant.
# 
# By convention, when the
# 
# 1. p-value is < 0.001: we say there is strong evidence that the correlation is significant.
# 2. the p-value is < 0.05: there is moderate evidence that the correlation is significant.
# 3. the p-value is < 0.1: there is weak evidence that the correlation is significant.
# 4. the p-value is > 0.1: there is no evidence that the correlation is significant.
#
